## Rules

Each player takes it in turn to join two neighbouring dots either horizontally
or vertically. A line is then drawn between the two dots.
The player that completes the dots creating a square (2 x 2 dots), captures
the square. The player with the most squares wins. If you or the computer captures a square, the player gets another turn.
